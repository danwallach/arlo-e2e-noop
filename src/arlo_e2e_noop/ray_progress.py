    This is where the progress bar starts. You create one of these on the head node,
    passing in the expected total number of items and a description key for each one.
    This will then manage one `tqdm` counter for each, simultaneously. For example,
    if you have 100 "Ballots" and 10 "Tallies", you might make
    `ProgressBar({"Ballots": 100, "Tallies": 10})`.

    Pass along the `actor` reference to any remote task. If, for example, the task just
    completed three "Ballots", it would then call: `actor.update_total.remote("Ballots", 3)`.

    Back on the head node, once you launch your remote Ray tasks, call `print_until_done()`,
    which will then print all the `tqdm` counters as they evolve, and will return when
    every counter has reached its specified total.

    If your program is the sort that discovers more work to do as it goes along, you can
    use the actor's `update_total` method.
